Great! Now that you've placed `YourTechBud.json` inside `LangGraph_and_pydanticAi/utils/data/`, your script is able to locate it correctly. ðŸŽ¯  

### **ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways**
1. **Folder Structure Matters**:  
   - Initially, you created `data/` outside `LangGraph_and_pydanticAi`, so the script couldn't find it.
   - Moving it inside `utils/data/` resolved the issue.

2. **How to Avoid This Issue in the Future**
   - Always check where your script **expects** files to be.
   - If unsure, print the full file path before reading:
     ```python
     import os
     print("Looking for:", os.path.abspath("utils/data/YourTechBud.json"))
     ```
   - Use `Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse | Select-String "YourTechBud.json"` in PowerShell to find misplaced files.

Now that it's working, what's next? Are you adding more functionality? ðŸš€
